# Data Steward Carpentry@SvetElisky

Data steward carpentry docs website. It server two main purposes.

1) To have a place for hosting my tutorials/writtings meant for the czech data steward community.
2) To learn more about documentation platforms, to try things out and have a playground of sorts.
